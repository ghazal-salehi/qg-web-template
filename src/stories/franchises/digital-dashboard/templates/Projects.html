            <strong>Objectives</strong>:<p>The NRS Integration project was initiated in response to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (Royal Commission) report (released in 2015) on Working with Children Checks (WWCC), highlighting a key issue with the lack of visibility of WWCC outcomes across jurisdictions.</p>
            <p>In the context of this issue, the Royal Commission recommended the implementation of a centralised information repository to share key WWCC decisions about individuals who have been prohibited from working with children across all jurisdictions which enables WWCC operators to make more informed assessments. In July 2019, the Federal Department of Human Services (DHS) and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) delivered the National Reference System (NRS) which is able to record, maintain and broadcast key decisions, by all jurisdictions for WWCCs and assist in the continuous monitoring of key decisions where a person is subsequently prohibited from working with children. Each jurisdiction is responsible for integrating their own systems with the NRS. </p>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to enable Queensland's blue card system to participate in this exchange. This requires both system and legislative change.  </p>

            <p>Stage 1 - Discovery and Analysis phase commenced in 2019 and detailed business requirements and a high level conceptual technical design were completed. It was originally anticipated that the Stage 2 - Delivery phase would be completed in 2020, however, the project was placed temporarily on hold due to: (1) the need to prioritise the implementation of the IT system changes required to support the Blue Card System's No Card, No Start laws on 31 August 2020; and (2) the impacts of the COVID-19 health emergency on QLD Government initiatives through the Savings and Debt Plan. </p>
            <p>The project was formally re-initiated in July 2021 and funded through an approved budget deferral. When the project was re-initiated, more detailed planning was completed and the project schedule and delivery approach was revised. During this process, it was identified that additional budget would be required to complete the project with the production release scheduled for the first half of 2022. </p>
            <p>The project status changed to 'Action Required' in April 2022 given a number of impacts (for example challenges in retaining and recruiting specialist contractors) effecting the planned velocity of project delivery. Since this time, recruitment and onboarding of the required specialist resources has been completed. A re-evaluation of the required delivery time and cost was undertaken and approved through an exception reporting process and the project returned to 'On Track' status effective end of June 2022. </p>
            <p>The project has now completed development,testing and other assurance activities and was successfully deployed to production on 14 December 2022 in parallel with legislation coming into effect. Project closure activities are now underway including development, testing and deployment of a warranty release and transitioning support for the technical solutions and business processes to operational teams. Going forward it will not be reported on the Digital Dashboard. </p>

            <p>A trial version of the digital drivers licence was developed and piloted during 2020 on the Fraser Coast, to test the technology and customers' willingness to use a digital licence. The trial received a satisfaction rating of 94 per cent from customers. TMR have now completed a review of the trial and based on its success, has commenced this new project to deliver a phased rollout of a state wide digital drivers licence which is highly secure and provides Queenslanders with a digital identity. </p>

            <p>The project was approved to proceed as an Essential project in May 2020. The project commenced with pilots in Hervey Bay and Gold Coast regions in order to test technology capabilities. On 28 March 2022, the Nerang and Pacific Pines Gold Coast DRT Services were successfully launched with final stages of the Hervey Bay service almost complete. The project has assessed the outcomes of the pilots to properly inform the procurement of the final solution. As such, the project received final investment approval and budget in November 2022 to commence final implementation of the solution. On 12 October 2022, the project board supported changing the Demand Responsive Transport Enabling Technology DRTET project's name to the On Demand Transport Enabling Technology (ODTET) project, this name change ensures there is delineation between the ODT Program and any future On-Demand Transport service deployments.</p>

            <p>Delivery stage commenced in July 2018. Regional bus hardware trials commenced in 2019 in five regional areas: Stradbroke Island, Bowen, Innisfail, Maryborough and Hervey Bay.  In 2020 all Gold Coast Light Rail Platform Validators were replaced with the new hardware and the new payment system was launched later that year. Currently, customers on the Gold Coast Light Rail can tap on and off with their debit/credit cards and smart devices (Adult fares only) in addition to gocards. </p>
            <p>In June 2021 customer trials of the new Platform Validators commenced on Queensland Rail (QR) stations, with subsequent roll-out of the validators across the QR network completing successfully in November 2021. Installation of upgraded Platform Access Gates on rail commenced in December 2021 to support the testing and trial of the new Smart Ticketing payment capabilities on heavy rail through the first half of 2022. </p>
            <p>In June 2022, the first Heavy Rail customer facing trial of the new payment system commenced on the Ferny Grove line. As at end December 2022, 98% of the SEQ train network is now activated for customers to trial Smart Ticketing.  Customers travelling through enabled stations can now tap on and off with their debit/credit cards and smart devices (Adult fares).<br>Activation of Smart Ticketing capability at AirTrain stations will complete the train network rollout in early 2023.</p>
            <p>The impacts of the Covid-19 global pandemic on supply chains and resources has resulted in an extension to the project end date. In December 2022, the Project Board accepted a revised schedule from the supplier which prioritises the delivery of new features for customers in 2023, with Provisional Acceptance of the completed solution by February 2024, and administrative closure of the project in June 2024.</p>
            <p>Despite the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 global pandemic on supply chains and resources to the overall schedule, the project remains on track to be delivered within budget.</p>
